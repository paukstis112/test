CloudCannon serves a 404 page when it can't find a file on your site. Customise and brand this page as your own.

To create a custom 404 page:

1. Create a file called `404.html` at the root of your site
2. Add the content you want CloudCannon to serve

> Set the `permalink` of your page to `/404.html` if you are using Jekyll and non-default permalinks.
