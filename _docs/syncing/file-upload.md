Uploading files through a web browser is a quick way to get a website live on CloudCannon.

To upload files from the *File Browser*:

1. Open the *Add Files* menu
2. Select **Upload files** or **Upload a folder**

> Alternatively, drag and drop files into the *File Browser*.

Uploading a folder uploads all files inside the folder, rather than the folder itself.

> Some browsers do not support folder upload. CloudCannon recommends syncing with a storage provider in this case.

Each file uploads individually to CloudCannon through your web browser. Unsupported files are greyed out, while any files with errors uploading are shown red.

> If the site is synced with a storage provider, CloudCannon pushes the files there as well.
