Collaborators are other CloudCannon users you have given access to one or more sites. Collaborators have two different share levels:

*Editors* make content changes with the [Visual Editor](/editing/visual-editor/), [Content Editor](/editing/content-editor/) and *Explore* section.
They have access to the recent activity in the *Reports* section.
The [Source Editor](/editing/source-editor/), *Site Settings* and *File Browser* are hidden and inaccessible.

*Technical Editors* have access to all files, editors, the *Site Settings* are hidden and inaccessible.

> Consider [creating an organisation](/organisations/getting-started/) with your team members to give them access to all sites instead.

To share a site with a collaborator:

1. Go to the *Site Settings* / *Sharing* section
2. Click on the desired share level
3. Enter the user's email address
