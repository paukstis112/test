CloudCannon is set up as a Service Provider (SP) to allow Single Sign On (SSO) for your organisation. To use this feature you must already have your own Identity Provider (IdP).


### Configuring SAML

> SAML can be a tricky thing to configure with only one end of debugging. If you would prefer manual assistance with setting up, please [contact support](mailto:support@cloudcannon.com).

To configure SAML with your IdP you will need the following details:

- SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)
- Issuer
- X.509 Certificate

> The issuer is configurable to allow multiple organisations from the same IdP. It must start with `cloudcannon.com/`. Leaving this blank will configure it as `cloudcannon.com`.

To add these details:

1. Go to *Organisation Settings* / *SAML*
2. Fill in all of the fields available and submit the form

Once configured you will get a screen defining any information you will need. If you require more information than displayed please [contact support](mailto:support@cloudcannon.com).
