Manage your Jekyll collections with ease in CloudCannon.

Collections are for managing groups of structured content. The concepts are similar to [Blogging](/editing/blogging/), without the chronological restriction. Collections have many applications, including: API documentation, products, albums and blog authors.

To access the easy-to-use CloudCannon interface for managing collections:

1. Add a Jekyll site with at least one collection
2. Go to the tab for your collection in the *Explore* section

![Empty collections interface](/images/editing/collections/collections-interface.png){: srcset="/images/editing/collections/collections-interface.png 800w, /images/editing/collections/collections-interface@2x.png 1600w"}
{: .has-screenshot}



To create a new collection item:

1. Open the *Add Files* menu in the top right corner and select **Add *Collection Name***
2. Enter a title/filename for the item and press enter

Your new file is opened in the [Content Editor](/editing/content-editor/). Front matter for the file is populated from [Collection Defaults](/editing/collection-defaults/) or an existing item to keep the structure consistent.

![Creating a new collection item](/images/editing/collections/adding-item.png){: srcset="/images/editing/collections/adding-item.png 800w, /images/editing/collections/adding-item@2x.png 1600w"}
{: .has-screenshot}



There are a number of ways to add content for your new item:

* Type the main content directly onto the page
* Insert images, links, and style your text with the editor controls above

> The owner and developers of a site can access the raw file content via the **Switch to Source Editor** button.

![Editing item](/images/editing/collections/edit-item.png){: srcset="/images/editing/collections/edit-item.png 800w, /images/editing/collections/edit-item@2x.png 1600w"}
{: .has-screenshot}

[Front matter](/editing/front-matter/) (e.g. title, description and thumbnail) is updated in the *Settings Panel*, accessed by selecting the **Toggle Settings** button in the top right corner.

> Hide front matter by putting it in [Jekyll Defaults](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults){: target="_blank"} instead.

To create a Jekyll collection to manage and display staff members, follow this example (assumes `/_layouts/default.html` exists):

1.  Define the staff members collection and default layout in `_config.yml`:

    ~~~
    collections:
      staff_members:
        output: true

    defaults:
      -
        scope:
          path: ""
          type: "staff_members"
        values:
          layout: "staff-member"
    ~~~

    Jekyll generates a page for each staff member with `output: true`. The default **staff-member** layout avoids setting it in each file.

2.  Create `/_staff_members/sam-doe.md` with the following content:

    ~~~
    ---
    name: Same Doe
    image: /uploads/sam.png
    credentials:
    phone_extension:
    ---
    ~~~

3.  Create `/staff.html` to display all staff members:

    ~~~
    {% raw %}---
    layout: default
    ---
    <ul class="staff-members">
      {% for member in site.staff_members %}
        <li class="staff-member">
          <img src="{{ member.image }}" alt="{{ member.name }}">
          <p>
            <a href="{{ member.url }}">
              {{ member.name }} - <strong>{{ member.credentials }}</strong>
            </a>
          </p>
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>{% endraw %}
    ~~~

    Jekyll provides the `url` attribute to link to the generated page for each staff member.

4.  Create the `staff-member` layout by creating `/_layouts/staff-member.html`. Generated staff member pages use this file:

    ~~~
    {% raw %}---
    layout: default
    ---
    <img src="{{ page.image }}" alt="{{ page.name }}">
    <h1>{{ page.name }} - {{ page.credentials }}</h1>
    <p>Phone extension: {{ page.phone_extension }}</p>
    {{ page.content }}{% endraw %}
    ~~~
